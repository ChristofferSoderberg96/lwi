The goal of lwi is to create a shareable common core of modular R
functionality that is used across Learning and Work Institute projects
and abides by good software engineering practices in documentation,
testing and version control.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ChristofferSoderberg96/lwi")
```

## Example

```

(Example usage forthcoming)
